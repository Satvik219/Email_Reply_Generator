---Overview---

The Email Reply Generator is a full-stack web application that automatically generates professional and context-aware email replies using artificial intelligence.
The backend is built with Spring Boot, the frontend uses React, and AI responses are generated by integrating the Gemini API through Spring’s WebClient.

--How It Works--

User enters the received email content in the React UI

The request is sent to the Spring Boot backend via REST API

Backend uses WebClient to call the Gemini API

Gemini generates a suitable email reply

The generated reply is returned and displayed to the user

-- Example--

Input Email:

“Can you please provide an update on the project?”

Generated Reply:

“Thank you for reaching out. The project is progressing as planned, and we will share a detailed update shortly.”
